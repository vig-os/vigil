# TDD

When implementing features or fixes that have testable behavior:

1. Write the failing test first. Run it. Confirm it fails.
2. **Commit** the failing test following the commit message standard in `CLAUDE.md` (`test: ...`). Do not proceed before committing.
3. Write minimal code to make the test pass. Run it. Confirm it passes. **Commit** the implementation.
4. Refactor. Run tests. Confirm no regressions. **Commit** the refactor if meaningful.

All commits must follow the commit message standard in `CLAUDE.md`. Never use `--no-verify`.

Each phase gets its own commit so the git history proves TDD compliance.

Do not write implementation code before its test. If you already wrote code, delete it and start with the test.

Skip TDD only for non-testable changes (config, templates, docs). Note why when skipping.

## Test scenario checklist

Before writing a test, evaluate which scenarios apply. Not every category applies to every change — skip with a note.

| Category | Consider |
|---|---|
| Happy path | Does the expected input produce the expected output? |
| Edge cases | Empty input, single element, max values, boundary values |
| Error paths | Invalid input, missing dependencies, network/IO failures |
| Input validation | Null, undefined, wrong type, malformed data |
| State & side effects | Does it modify state correctly? Cleanup? |
| Idempotency | Does running the operation twice produce the same result as once? |
| Concurrency | Do parallel or overlapping executions corrupt state or race? |
| Regression | If fixing a bug, does the test prove the bug is fixed? |
| Canary | Inject a known-bad state into the real environment, confirm the guard catches it, clean up |
| Smoke | After integration, does the system start and key flows work? |

## Test types

Use the narrowest type that covers the behavior. Prefer unit tests. Escalate only when the behavior crosses boundaries.

- **Unit** — isolated function behavior, fast, no external dependencies
- **Integration** — components working together, may need fixtures or containers
- **Smoke** — system starts, critical paths respond (post-deploy or post-build)
- **E2E** — full user flow through the system
