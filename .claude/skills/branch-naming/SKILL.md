# Topic Branch Naming and Workflow

When the user asks to create or start work on an issue (e.g. "create branch for issue 36", "start working on issue 36", or references `.github_data/issues/issue-36.md`), follow this workflow.

## Workflow: Create and link a development branch

1. **Verify no developer branch is linked yet**
   - Run: `gh issue develop --list <issue_number>`
   - If the issue already has a linked branch, tell the user and offer to checkout that branch locally (`git fetch origin && git checkout <branch_name>`) or stop. Do not create a second linked branch.

2. **Infer branch type**
   - From issue labels or intent, pick one: `feature` | `bugfix` | `release`.
   - Ask the user if labels and title are ambiguous.

3. **Set short summary**
   - From the issue title or description, derive a kebab-case `short_summary` (a few words).
   - Omit prefixes like "FEATURE", "BUG", "Add". Example: "Standardize and Enforce Commit Message Format" → `standardize-commit-messages`.

4. **Propose branch name and ask for validation**
   - Propose: `<type>/<issue_number>-<short_summary>` (e.g. `feature/36-standardize-commit-messages`).
   - Explicitly ask the user to confirm or give a different name before proceeding.

5. **Determine base branch**
   - Check if the issue has a parent: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue_number}/parent --jq '.number'`
   - If a parent exists, resolve its linked branch: `gh issue develop --list <parent_number>`. Use the parent's branch as `<base_branch>`. If the parent has no linked branch, fall back to `dev`.
   - If no parent exists, use `dev` as `<base_branch>`.

6. **Create and link the branch via GitHub**
   - After user confirms: `gh issue develop <issue_number> --base <base_branch> --name <branch_name> --checkout`
   - This creates the branch on the remote from `<base_branch>`, links it to the issue, and checks it out locally. If `gh` reports that the branch already exists on the remote, run `git fetch origin` and `git checkout <branch_name>` instead.

7. **Ensure local branch is up to date**
   - After checkout: `git pull origin <branch_name>` (if the branch already had commits and you created it via another path, or to sync with remote).

## Branch name format (reference)

### Issue-tied branches

```
<type>/<issue_number>-<short_summary>
```

Example: `feature/36-standardize-commit-messages`, `bugfix/42-fix-login-bug`

### Chore branches (no issue required)

```
chore/<short_summary>
```

Example: `chore/sync-main-to-dev`, `chore/update-dependencies`

Every other commit type whose `Refs:` line is optional in this repo
(`DEVKIT_REFS_OPTIONAL_TYPES` in `.vig-os`) gets the same issue-less
`<type>/<short_summary>` form, e.g. `docs/vendor-quotation` with
`DEVKIT_REFS_OPTIONAL_TYPES=chore,docs`. A branch may skip the issue only where
its commits may, and `chore/` is always allowed
([#1767](https://github.com/vig-os/devkit/issues/1767)).

## Branch types (reference)

| Type     | Issue Required | Use for                                                                 |
|----------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| feature  | Yes            | New functionality, enhancements                                         |
| bugfix   | Yes            | Bug fixes (non-urgent)                                                  |
| release  | Yes            | Release preparation, version bumps, release notes                       |
| chore   | No             | Maintenance tasks, syncing branches, dependency updates, routine work   |

The issue-numbered type set is per-repo configurable: `DEVKIT_BRANCH_TYPES` in
`.vig-os` replaces it (e.g. adding a project-specific `record` type), steering
the local branch guard AND CI's branch-name gate from one key — check that
file before proposing a type outside the table. The stock issue-numbered set
is `feature,bugfix,hotfix,release,docs,test,refactor`
([#1432](https://github.com/vig-os/devkit/issues/1432)).

Both enforcement points — the local `validate-branch-name` pre-commit hook and
CI's branch-name gate — run the same vig-utils `validate-branch-name`, which
also admits `main`, `dev` (gitflow), `worktree/<issue>`, `renovate/*` and
`release/X.Y.Z` ([#1760](https://github.com/vig-os/devkit/issues/1760)). Check
the current branch with `prek run validate-branch-name`.

## One-off branch name only

When the user only wants a branch name suggestion (no "create" or "start work"), propose the name in the format above and do not run the full workflow.
