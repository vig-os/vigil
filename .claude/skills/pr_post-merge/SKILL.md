# After PR merge: cleanup and switch branch

When the user asks to clean up after a PR merge (or to "delete PR text, checkout base, update, delete branch locally"), follow these steps.

## Context

After opening a PR from a feature branch (e.g. `feature/34-...`) into a base branch (e.g. `feature/37-...`) and the PR is merged, the user may want to:
- Remove the local PR draft file
- Switch to the base branch and update it
- Delete the feature branch locally

## Steps

1. **Delete the PR text file**
   If the user created a draft at `.github/pr-<issue>-into-<base>.md` (e.g. `.github/pr-34-into-37.md`), delete that file.

2. **Checkout the base branch**
   Check out the branch that was the PR base (e.g. `feature/37-automate-standardize-repository-setup`).
   Infer the branch name from the user's wording (e.g. "branch 37" → `feature/37-automate-standardize-repository-setup`; use `gh issue develop --list <issue>` if needed to resolve the branch name).

3. **Update the base branch**
   Run:
   `git pull origin <base-branch>`

4. **Delete the feature branch locally**
   Delete the branch that was merged (e.g. `feature/34-rename-venv-container-creation`).
   Run:
   `git branch -d <feature-branch>`
   Use the branch name the user indicates (e.g. "branch 34" → `feature/34-...`; list with `git branch` if needed).

## Delegation

All steps in this skill are mechanical cleanup operations and SHOULD be delegated:

Spawn a Task subagent with `model: "fast"` that:
1. Identifies and deletes the PR draft file (if it exists)
2. Determines the base branch name (via user input or `gh issue develop --list`)
3. Checks out the base branch
4. Pulls updates from origin
5. Identifies and deletes the feature branch locally (via `git branch -d`)

Returns: confirmation of each step (file deleted, branch switched, branch updated, branch deleted) or errors if any step fails.

This entire workflow is data-gathering and CLI execution, making it ideal for lightweight delegation.

Reference: [subagent-delegation rule](../subagent-delegation/SKILL.md)

## Notes

- Confirm which PR file, base branch, and feature branch to use from the user's message or ask if ambiguous.
- If the user says "delete branch 34 locally", the feature branch is the one for issue 34 (e.g. `feature/34-rename-venv-container-creation`).
- This workflow applies to both feature branches (to `dev`) and fix branches (to `release/X.Y.Z`). For the full release workflow, see [`docs/RELEASE_CYCLE.md`](https://github.com/vig-os/devkit/blob/main/docs/RELEASE_CYCLE.md).
