# Subagent Delegation

When executing skills, delegate mechanical sub-steps to lightweight subagents via the Task tool to reduce token consumption on the primary model.

## Model Tiers

See [.claude/agent-models.toml](../../agent-models.toml) for the single source of truth. Summary:

- **lightweight** (`composer-1.5`) — CLI commands, API calls, file reading, parsing, template filling
- **standard** (`sonnet-4.5`) — structured analysis, code review with clear inputs
- **autonomous** (`opus-4.6`) — design, planning, code generation, debugging

## When to Delegate

Delegate a step if it matches one of these patterns:

### Pattern: Data Gathering (use lightweight)

- **Precondition checks** — branch name validation, regex parsing
- **Issue/PR fetching** — `gh issue view`, `gh api`, `gh pr list`, `git log`
- **File reading** — reading config files, parsing JSON/YAML
- **CLI execution** — running tests, checking git status

Example:

```markdown
Spawn a Task subagent with `model: "fast"` that:
1. Runs `gh issue view <issue_number> --json title,body,labels,comments`
2. Parses the JSON output
3. Returns the parsed data as a structured response
```

### Pattern: Formatting (use lightweight)

- **Template filling** — populating markdown templates with data
- **Comment posting** — formatting and posting GitHub issue/PR comments
- **Progress updates** — updating markdown task lists with checkboxes
- **Report generation** — formatting verification results, CI status

Example:

```markdown
Spawn a Task subagent with `model: "fast"` that:
1. Takes the formatted markdown body
2. Posts it via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue_number}/comments -f body="..."`
3. Returns the comment URL
```

### Pattern: Structured Review (use standard)

- **Code review** — analyzing diffs against acceptance criteria
- **Log analysis** — parsing CI failure logs, extracting key errors
- **Verification** — checking test results, lint output against expectations

Example:

```markdown
Spawn a Task subagent with `readonly: true` that:
1. Reads the diff and issue acceptance criteria
2. Reviews the changes following the code review checklist
3. Returns a structured report with Critical/Important/Minor issues
```

### Pattern: Keep in Main Agent (no delegation)

Do NOT delegate if the step requires:

- **Deep reasoning** — architectural decisions, design trade-offs
- **Code generation** — writing implementation code, tests
- **Debugging** — root cause analysis, hypothesis formation
- **Tight loops** — TDD RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles that need shared context

## How to Delegate in Skills

In a skill's `## Delegation` section, specify which steps should use subagents:

```markdown
## Delegation

The following steps SHOULD be delegated to reduce token consumption:

- **Step 1-2** (precondition check, read issue): Spawn a Task subagent with
  `model: "fast"` that runs gh CLI commands and returns parsed JSON.
- **Step 6** (publish comment): Spawn a Task subagent with `model: "fast"` that
  posts the formatted comment and returns the comment URL.

```

## Important Notes

- Skills are markdown instructions, not executable code. The agent executing the skill reads these delegation instructions and decides when to spawn subagents.
- Use `model: "fast"` for lightweight tasks (data-gathering, formatting).
- Omit the `model` parameter for standard-tier tasks (it defaults to the session model or a capable mid-tier model).
- Always pass sufficient context to the subagent — it has no access to the parent session's state.
- The Task tool's `description` parameter should be concise (3-5 words), while the `prompt` should contain all necessary context and instructions.
